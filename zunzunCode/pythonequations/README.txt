You will need to install python, numpy and scipy to
run this software.See the Examples directory to get
started, all of the examples should run by using
"python examplename.py" at a command prompt. 

I hope you find this code useful, that is its purpose,
and to that end I have sprinkled explanatory comments
liberally throughout the code.  If you have any questions
or comments, please e-mail me directly at zunzun@zunzun.com.

The source code should automatically clean up weave's
temporary files whenever a new version of this code is
installed and imported by Python.  If you are actively
developing or modifying the source code on a non-Unix
computer, note that you will likely need to manually
delete the temporary files that are generated by weave
after every code edit.
