You will need to install python, numpy and scipy to run this software.

See the Examples directory to get started. All of the examples should
run by typing "python examplename.py" at a command prompt. 

I hope you find this code useful, and to that end I have sprinkled
explanatory comments throughout the code.  If you have any questions
or comments, please e-mail me directly at zunzun@zunzun.com.
