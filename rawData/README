This folder is meant to hold the raw data from the aid dosimetry notebook.

FIRST: CREATE A NEW FILE FOR EACH DATE RANGE

Create a new file using the file name of '[start date]-[end date]' without the quotes. The date should be the same format of the 'Sampled Days' from the notebook, YYYYMMDD, eg. 20120129-20120202 for the range Jan. 29 2012 - Feb. 02 2012.

SECOND: ENTER THE DATA

The format is shown at the bottom of this page. 

NOTE: THE FORMAT IS VERY PICKY. So follow the format exactly.


#This shouldn't be a problem anymore, but haven't tested it
SECOND NOTE: USE A TEXT EDITOR WITH A '\n' NEWLINE RETURN. THIS IS HARDCODED IN THE PROGRAM
Basically this means don't use Windows to type these files (Probably could be easily fixed, but I'm not as familiar with Windows and don't want to take the time to look it up when it works fine on *nix systems). Also make sure to use a text editor and not Office or something similar. 

THIRD: RUN THE PROGRAM

To use the program, simply type in a Linux terminal (w/o the quotes): 
	'python calculate.py [filename]'

FOURTH: CHECK OUTPUT WITH DATA BOOK

This will print the relevant data to the screen to double check the data with the hard copy (the data is truncated when printed to the screen for easier reading)
This datafile is then used with the other python program to determine the coefficients and the constants


FILE FORMAT:
Format:
Filter number
Start Date YYYYMMDD
End date   YYYYMMDD
Sample Time (in hours)
Sample Volume (in m^3)
t_stop (HHMMSS),alpha Calibration Number, Beta Calibration Number
t (HHMMSS),DET2(betaAlpha#),CFC,DET1(alpha#)


DEPENDENCIES:
You just need python (2.7+, not sure if it works with 3.x yet), most Linux distros should ship with it.
