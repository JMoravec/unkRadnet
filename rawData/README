This folder is meant to hold the raw data from the aid dosimetry notebook.

FIRST: CREATE A NEW FILE FOR EACH DATE RANGE

Create a new file using the file name of '[start date]-[end date]' without the quotes. The date should be the same format of the 'Sampled Days' from the notebook, YYYYMMDD, eg. 20120129-20120202 for the range Jan. 29 2012 - Feb. 02 2012.

SECOND: ENTER THE DATA

The format is shown at the bottom of this page. 

NOTE: THE FORMAT IS VERY PICKY. So follow the format exactly, or you WILL get errors or miscalculations.

SECOND NOTE: USE A TEXT EDITOR WITH A '\n' NEWLINE RETURN. THIS IS HARDCODED IN THE PROGRAM
Basically this means don't use Windows to type these files (Probably could be easily fixed, but I'm not as familiar with Windows and don't want to take the time to look it up when it works fine on *nix systems). Also make sure to use a text editor and not Office or something similar. 

THIRD: CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE CALIBRATION NUMBERS ARE CORRECT.

Check calculate.c to make sure the constants ALPHACALIBRATION and BETACALIBRATION are the correct numbers. These variables are on line 19,20 of the file at the time of this writing.

THIRD(2): CHANGE THE CONSTANTS AND RECOMPILE

If the constants are not correct, change the numbers, save the file, and recompile the program:
In Linux type this (w/o the quotes) in a terminal: 
	'gcc calculate.c'
which will compile the program to a.out

FOURTH: RUN THE PROGRAM

To use the program, simply type in a Linux terminal (w/o the quotes): 
	'./a.out [data file]'. 
(or write a script to run the program multiple times)

FIFTH: CHECK OUTPUT WITH DATA BOOK

This will print the relevant data to the screen to double check the data with the hard copy (the data is truncated when printed to the screen for easier reading)
This datafile is then used with the other python program to determine the coefficients and the constants

SIXTH: MOVE THE RESULTING FILE TO THE PROPER PLACE

The resulting file will be named: 'STARTDATE-ENDDATEActivity'. You're probably going to wwant to move it to the fitToCurve folder to run the splitData.py program on it to get the coeffition numbers for the double exponential.
To move in Linux, just use your favorite file manager to drag and drop, or if using the terminal:
	'mv [filename] [destination]'
will work. If using the terminal and moving lots of data, using the wildcard '*' character will help a lot. eg. 'mv *Activity ../foobar' will move everything that ends with 'Activity' to the directory 'foobar' in one directory up from where you are.

FILE FORMAT:
Every line beginning with a '#' will be ignored. Use this for comments
Format:
# Filter number
# Start Date YYYYMMDD
# End date   YYYYMMDD
# Sample Time (in hours)
# Sample Volume (in m^3)
t_stop (HHMMSS),alpha Calibration Number, Beta Calibration Number
t (HHMMSS),DET2(beta,alpha),CFC,DET1(alpha)

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T PUT SPACES IN-BETWEEN THE NUMBERS

DEPENDENCIES:
You just need a compiler to compile the program, I suggest gcc
I believe in Ubuntu:
	'apt-get install build-essential'
will get you the necessary programs/libraries
