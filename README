These files are for the University of Nebraska at Kearney Physics Radnet research project group. 

The project licence for the code and data for the project can be found in LICENCE.txt in the home folder. For the curve fitting data code we used zunzun.com's code. That unmodified code and the licence for that project may be found in the ./zunzunCode/pythonequations folder.


DEPENDENCIES:
	For calculate.py, the only dependency is to have python (2.7+, haven't tested on python3)
	For fitToCurve.py you will need to have python, numpy, and scipy installed 
		For Ubuntu based:
		'apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy '
		should get the python libraries it working.

TO RUN:
	Add the file to rawData folder and run:
		python calculate.py [filename]
	After a succesful upload run:
		sqlite3 ../sql/radnet.db
		SELECT FilterID FROM Filter WHERE StartDate = [startDate]
		.exit
		cd ../fitToCurve
		python fitToCurve.py [filterid from before]

CREATING A NEW DATAFILE:
	Create a new file using the file name of '[start date]-[end date]' without the quotes. The date should be the same format of the 'Sampled Days' from the notebook, YYYYMMDD, eg. 20120129-20120202 for the range Jan. 29 2012 - Feb. 02 2012. It should also be in the same folder as start.py. The program will move it to rawData after success.

DATAFILE FORMAT:
All data entries should be numbers only.

Format:
Filter number
Start Date YYYYMMDD
End date   YYYYMMDD
Sample Time (in hours)
Sample Volume (in m^3)
t_stop (HHMMSS),alpha Calibration Number, Beta Calibration Number
t (HHMMSS),DET2(betaAlpha#),CFC,DET1(alpha#)

For more information on the data entry and the calculate.py program see the README in the ./rawData folder.
