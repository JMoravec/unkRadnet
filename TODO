This is a note to everyone, but mostly for myself for future ideas for the code.

1. Take a look at splitData.py and see if i'm calculating the coefficients twice. might save some time since the program is somewhat slow.

2. organize the folders/files better.
	its a bitt messy as of right now. could use some cleaning up

3. change the programs to print to a better place.
	not too big of a fan of having the final products in the same folder as all the data. if i change the code to write the file to the correct folder, it would get rid of that clutter.

LONGTERM:
Perhaps port the calculate.c program to python to get one cohesive program. shouldn't be too difficult
