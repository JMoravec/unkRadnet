#	This is the data for the alpha data
#	The data was fit to a linear combination of 2 exponential functions in the form:
#		y = a * exp(bx) + c exp(dx)
#	The data follows as:
#
# Start Date (YYYYMMDD), a , b , c , d
#
#		NOTE: The b and d values should be negative for this 
#       		data set (as we want an exponential decay)
