Fits the data from a filter to a double exponential curve

RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
simply run:
	'python splitData.py [filterID]'
	to get the filterid, you'll need to use sql (filter table)

This will print the coefficients to file as well as add the data to the database

DEPENDENCIES:
You will need to have an installation of numpy and scipy on your computer to run the python program. This depencency is from the zunzun.com code and is necessary for the curve fitting (you'll get an error if you don't have it)
On Ubuntu:
	'apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy'
