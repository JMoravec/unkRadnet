To compile the data: first check calculate.c to make sure the constants ALPHACALIBRATION and BETACALIBRATION are the correct numbers.
If not, you will need to recompile the program:
In Linux: 
	gcc calculate.c
will compile the program to a.out

To use the program, simply type (in Linux) ./a.out [data file] 
this will print the relevant data to the screen to double check the data (the data is truncated when printed to the screen for easier reading)
This datafile is then used with the other python program to determine the coefficients and the constants
